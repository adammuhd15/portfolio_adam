                        <p>Hello my fellow readers. I have an interest in designing web pages. I started learning how to code when I was in my first year of university in 2015. From then, I took interest in learning and improving my coding skills. I recently learned how to design and develop web pages, and I am spending more hours on improving my programming skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have a passion for learning and improving because I like to use lessons to gain more knowledge and experience to strive to be more successful in my work. In my freetime, I like to spend some of my time with my family because I love socializing. For the rest of my freetime, I always go to the gym because exercising regularly makes me feel good when I am doing work.</p><br />

                                <p>I attended this institution to study Mechanical Engineering as my course. Throughout my four years as an undergraduate, I have developed many technical skills that was required to complete my assigned projects. Other than that, I also have developed various soft skills to have better communication with team members to increase the productivity of our work.</p>

Being in a boarding school at the age of 14 has taught me to be very independent. The first skill that I had to develop was being organized, and this has helped me to prepare my schedule and taking care of my belongings.</p>
